# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a simple machine learning based system to predict diabetes using
a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The project focuses on basic data preprocessing,
feature scaling, and model evaluation to understand how machine learning can be applied
to medical datasets for prediction tasks.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data loading and validation  
2. Feature scaling using StandardScaler  
3. Train-test split  
4. Model training using Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy score
